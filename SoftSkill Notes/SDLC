1. What is SDLC ?

- A formalized framework describing activities and steps to develop/build
    software.

- Basically, SDLC is stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

- It contains 6 steps/phases.

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Design
3. Develop
4. Test
5. Release
6. Maintenance


--------------1--Requirement Gathering----------------------
- In this step, the Product Owner (PO) and the business team
  collects the requirements from the client.

  ----------Business Team--------------
  1. Project Manager
  2. Product Owner
  3. Business Analyst

  Who is client/ stakeholders ?

- who has the idea of the application.
- who owns the app after building.
- who spend money for build the app.

 PO write  all the requirements into the document.(SRS)
 SRS -> Software Requirement Specification

 PO is voice the client. PO always work together with client.

 PM has more than one application but PO has just one.

if you write a good SRS, you must follow SMART criteria.
----SMART--------------------------
1. S pecific,
2. M easurable,
3. A chievable,
4. R elevant,(Konuyla ilgili)
5. T estable. ( test edilebilir)

------------2--Designing-------------------------------------
- Designers design the app ,
design the prototype, design the blueprint
according to SRS document.

- Designers create design document -> SDS (Software Design Specification)

- who performs ?
- Designer

---------------3--Coding---------------------------------------
- Developers build the app in Dev Environment based on SRS and SDS

- Developers perform/apply this step.

- As a output -> Initial version of the app. -> v1

- It is the longest SDLC step.

-----------------4--Testing-----Quality Assurance-------------------

- Test the software in the QA environment. https://qa.amazon.com

- purpose: to find bugs or defects. bugfree app...

- bugs or defect should be fixed by developers .

- SDET compares actual result with the expected result.

- What is bug?

- Expected result doesn't match with the actual result.

-----------------5--Deploy/ Release / Production-------------

- End users use the app in the production environment.  https://amazon.com

- End users find bug or defects in this step. !!! ???

----------------6--Maintaining---------------------------------

- Support team : Receive bug or defects from end users. Then fix it.

- The client has new ideas about the app?

- SDLC start again with the new requests.
